# Coding Process
For this site, I used HTML, Sass, and Javascript. The site is Responsive, and was conceived with a desktop first design.

This is my first proyect made with Sass instead of plain CSS. I tried to add as many Sass features as possible. If you check the scss folder, you can see I make use of imports, variables, and extensions. 

The Js scripts is in charge of handling the Sandwich Menú, in order to make the site full responsive.
